# Terraform Lab 2

## Overview 
In this lab you will update the existing `main.tf` file to use variables. 

**NOTE: If you run out of disk space remove the `.terraform` directory from previous labs**

## Set the instance name with a variable
Under our working directory create a `tf-lab2` directory and copy `main.tf` to our new directory: 
```sh
mkdir tf-lab2 
cd $_
cp ../tf-lab1/main.tf . 
```
The configuration in `main.tf` includes hard-coded values. Terraform variables allow you to write configuration that is easier to re-use and flexible. 

Add a variable to define the instance name. 

Create a new file called `variables.tf` with a block that defines a new `instance_name` variable. 

```hcl
variable "instance_name" {
  description    = "Name tag for EC2 instance"
  type           = string
  default        = "Lab2-TF-example"
}
```

Now update the `main.tf` `aws_instance` resource block to use our new variable. 

```
  tags = {
    Name = var.instance_name
  }
```

We also need to update the resource name in `main.tf` to `lab2-tf-example`
```
..snip
resource "aws_instance" "lab2-tf-example" {
  ami           = "ami-830c94e3"
  ..snip
}
```
After updating the resource block to use the new variable apply the configuration 

```sh
terraform apply
```

If everything looks good, respond with `yes` to the prompt.

Now apply the configuration again, but pass the variable on the command-line. 
```sh
terraform apply -var 'instance_name=SomeOtherName'
```

Variables passed via the command-line will not be saved , so you need to repeatedly set them, or add them to a variables file.

## Query Data with Outputs
In this lab you will use output values to organize data to be queried and shown back to the user. 

Create a file called `outputs.tf` to output the instance's ID and Public IP address with the following: 
```hcl
output "instance_id" {
  description    = "ID of the EC2 instance"
  value          = aws_instance.lab2-tf-example.id
}

output "instance_public_ip" {
  description   = "Public IP address of EC2 instance"
  value       = aws_instance.lab2-tf-example.public_ip
}
```

## Inspect output values
You must apply the new configuration before you can use these output values. 

Apply the configuration using `terraform apply`

Terraform now prints output values to the screen every time you apply your configuration. Query the outputs using the `terraform output` command. 

Output will be similar to: 
```
instance_id = "i-0bf954919ed765de1"
instance_public_ip = "54.186.202.254"
```

You can use Terraform outputs to connect Terraform projects with other parts of your infrastructure or CICD pipelines. 


# Cleanup
Destroy the infrastructure you created
```sh
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

# Congrats!

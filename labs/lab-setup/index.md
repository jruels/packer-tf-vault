## Lab Setup
In this lab you will log into the AWS Console and start a CloudShell session. We will be using this for all future labs. 

### Log into the AWS Cloud Console
To log into the console go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/ in a browser. Once you have logged in, on the top right side, select the `US-East-2` region.
